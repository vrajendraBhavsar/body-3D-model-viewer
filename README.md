Body 3D Model Viewer
=======================

This is a demo of OpenGL ES 2.0.
It is basically an android application with a 3D engine that can load Wavefront OBJ, STL, DAE & GLTF files.
The purpose of this application is to learn and share how to draw using OpenGL language.

* Wafefront format (OBJ): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file
* STereoLithography format (STL): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)
* Collada format (DAE): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA
* GLTF format (gltf): https://www.khronos.org/gltf/

Notice
======

* Collada support is limited. Collada renderer currently supports a maximum of 60 bones.
* In order to see models in 3D virtual reality, you need red-cyan and/or VR glasses
* If you have any issue in general,please open an issue and attach model if possible, specifying Android version and Device model.  


About
=====

Load 3D models and see how to do it with this open source code application.

The main purpose of this app is to show how to draw in android using the OpenGL 2.0 by sharing the source code.
So please, don't expect this application to be much richer or nicer than the ones already published in the app store,
but at least it's opened to anyone who wants to contribute or don't want to start a similar project from scratch.

As this is my first android app and Im still learning the OpenGL 2.0 language, it is highly probable that there are bugs;
but I will try to continue improving the app and adding more features. So please send me your comments, suggestions or
complains by opening an [issue](https://github.com/the3deer/android-3D-model-viewer/issues).

The app comes with some included 3D models that have different licenses.

Try it
======

You can install the application in either of these ways:

  * Play Store:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.andresoviedo.dddmodel2
  * APK: [app-release.apk](app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk)
  * Source code: clone the repository, compile with gradle and install with adb

```
    export ANDROID_HOME=/home/$USER/Android/Sdk
    ./gradlew assembleDebug
    adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk
    adb shell am start -n org.andresoviedo.dddmodel2/org.the3deer.app.model3D.MainActivity
```

Open the application. You should see a menu. From there you can load models
Once the model is rendered, pinch and rotate to see the 3D scene from another perspective.
